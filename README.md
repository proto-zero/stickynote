## This is an app built in Ruby on Rails with a PostGres Database. 

## Notes

Users can write simple messages in the input box and store them in the database. 

Hovering over a message reveals an X which, when clicked, deletes the message.

The app uses responsive design to function properly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Ruby Version
    3.0.2

## Database
    Use PostGres as the database for Active Record

If you want your own version of this, you should:
